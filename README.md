This project focuses on text preprocessing techniques essential for natural language processing tasks. It includes functions for lemmatization, tokenization, 
and stop word removal using NLTK libraries in Python. The preprocess_sentence function specifically processes input sentences by converting text to lowercase, 
removing stop words, and lemmatizing words to their base forms. These steps are crucial for improving the quality and efficiency of subsequent text analysis
tasks such as sentiment analysis, document classification, or any application requiring clean and standardized text data.
